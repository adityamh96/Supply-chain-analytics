## Executive summary

Internet of things (IoT) takes multiple devices like security cameras, GPS tracking, retail POS machines, etc. and connects them to a cellular network connection. Such connected devices are considered a part of an IoT network when they communicate back and forth with a central hub. In recent years, the rise of the Internet of things (IoT) as an emerging technology has been unbelievable, more companies are moving towards the adoption of these technologies and many IoT devices are being deployed to share information in real-time which leads to the generation of a huge amount of data. This data when used correctly, will be very helpful to the company to discover hidden patterns for better decision making in the future. 

For example, with the DataCo company, dataset shipment analysis was performed in this project which helps the company to better understand its supply chain and target critical factors to increase customer responsiveness and the companyâ€™s revenue.
In this project we compared 3 popular regressors type machine learning models and measured their performance to find out which machine learning model performs better. Since the dataset used is related to supply chain, important parameters are related to shipment and the machine learning models are trained with the shipment dataset.

The machine learning models used in this project are Linear Regression, Random Forest regression, and Gradient Boosting regression to predict number of days for shipment which are compared with mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE).
